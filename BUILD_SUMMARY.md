## üîÑ Next Steps for APK Creation

### Option 1: Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
```bash
# Install WSL if not already installed
wsl --install

# In WSL terminal:
cd /mnt/e/Code\ -\ Projects/NoTrace/mobile
chmod +x build_apk.sh
./build_apk.sh
```

### Option 2: Using Linux/Ubuntu Virtual Machine
1. Copy the `mobile/` folder to a Linux environment
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   chmod +x build_apk.sh
   ./build_apk.sh
   ```

### Option 3: Using GitHub Actions (Automated)
- Push the code to GitHub
- Use the provided workflow in `.github/workflows/`
- APK will be built automatically in the cloud
